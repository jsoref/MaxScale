/** Currently SmartRouter is configured like this (star means many):
 *  SmartRouter -*> ServerAsService -> MaxscaleRouter -*> Server
 *  For the time being the limitation is that the tail router must be RWSplit.
 *  This will change once we implement it so that SmartRouter can call the tail router directly.
 *  Although the assumption is one RowServer and one ColumnServer, the code does not assume that,
 *  it simply forces you to state which Cluster is the master.
 *  Currently SmartRouter fails if any Cluster fails. That need not be the case, Clusters could
 *  be marked "is_critical" meaning non-critical non-masters, could be allowed to fail.
